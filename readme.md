# Unsupervised Clustering of Noun Semantics 
### Cody Kingham

This repository contains project data and analysis for my upcoming article on 
applying unsupervised clustering techniques (e.g. PCA) to analyze the semantics 
of nouns in the Hebrew Bible using the Eep Talstra Centre's BHSA dataset. I plot 
the resulting data and also do some analysis with Gephi. The result is that interesting 
patterns emerge, such as a separation of nouns into more and less animate groups. The 
draft article that accompanies this repository is currently in preparation.

All of the analysis takes place in the [analysis notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/codykingham/noun_semantics/blob/master/analysis.ipynb).

## Contents 

* [analysis](analysis.ipynb) - main analysis in a Jupyter Notebook
* [results](results) - plots, tables, Gephi data produced by the analysis
* [dataset.csv](dataset.csv) - the dataset used for the analysis 
* [pyscripts](pyscripts) -Â Python scripts that build the dataset
* [docs](docs) - mainly image files and schemas for documentation of methods
